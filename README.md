# MovieRater

Dev Team Fox1


The Movie Rater app is designed to allow users to add movies and TV shows to a database, and rate movies and TV shows in the database.  Currently, the app allows all users to both make changes to the database content (add and remove movies and TV shows) and create ratings for each piece of content.

Our team created a Miro board to track our AGILE workflow method:
